    <h3>Chocolate-Peanut-Butter Pie
        Recipe By Brynie Greisman</h3>
    <p>This pie takes about 5 minutes to make and is very rich and luscious. Chocolate and peanut butter are always a
        winning combo, and one of my favorites, unfortunately! The photographer thought it was heavenly!!!! A sliver of
        this satisfies anyone’s sweet tooth.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>1</strong> ready-made Glicks Graham Cracker Pie Crust
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2 (8-oz./225-g.) containers</strong> dessert whip
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>10.5 ounces (300 grams, or 3 large bars)</strong> Elite Bittersweer Chocolate, or
            other good quality bitterweet chocolate
        <li>
            <strong>3 heaping tablespoons</strong> Gefen Peanut Butter
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Start Cooking!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place whip, chocolate, and peanut butter in a pot. Mix together over medium flame until chocolate is melted
            and all ingredients are mixed well together. Pour onto pie crust.</li>
        <li>When cool, decorate with chcolate curls (see note), chepped roasted peanuts, and/or and additional whipped
            dessert whip. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Remove from freezer and put in fridge for aproximately half an hour prior to serving</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> How to make chocolate curls: Make sure the chocolate is at room temperature for a while —
        it works best when it’s warm. I used baking chocolate and peeled down the side of it with a vegetable peeler.
        You can freeze the leftover curls for future use.</p>
